# Introduction to Big Data Analytics using Hadoop MapReduce with Python

This full-day workshop aims to provide participants with a detailed knowledge on:

- The concepts of MapReduce programming paradigm
- How this programming paradigm can leverage the characteristics of
the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to process massive amount of data
- How to integrate Hadoop-based data analytics components into standard HPC workflow on Palmetto


By the end of the workshop, the participants are expected to be able to:

- Be able to interact with data stored in HDFS
- Be able to write MapReduce programs in Python and run them on data stored on HDFS
- Be able to interact with YARN, the job scheduler in HDFS to find out information
about the running MapReduce programs
- Be able to analyze YARN log information to debug and optimize MapReduce programs
- Be able to write PBS scripts to launch Hadoop jobs and extract results.
